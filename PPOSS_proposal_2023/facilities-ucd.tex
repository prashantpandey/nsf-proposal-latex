\section*{Facilities---UC Davis}

\acro{PI} Owens's research group features \acro{GPU}-equipped workstations for each graduate student in the group. Materials and supplies funds from this proposal will cover upgrades to these computing resources for the students on this project, as well as the following servers. The group currently has six first-class \acro{GPU} compute servers and a shared high-bandwidth file server, including an \acro{NVIDIA}-donated \acro{DGX} Station (Volta), two \acro{NVIDIA} Ampere \acro{GPU}s, and a new \acro{AMD}-donated server with two new \acro{AMD} server-grade \acro{GPU}s. All have Intel Xeon or \acro{AMD} server-class \acro{CPU}s, 4 \acro{NVIDIA} \acro{GPU}s (mostly \acro{V}100s and \acro{GV}100s), 256+~\acro{GB} of memory, and Flash and traditional hard disk storage. Except for the \acro{AMD} server, their motherboards feature \acro{GPUD}irect interconnect and they are connected by Infiniband. \acro{UC} Davis also provides an office for the \acro{PI}, a laboratory for his advised students, and rack space for our compute servers. We believe we have access to the best tools available to conduct our research.
