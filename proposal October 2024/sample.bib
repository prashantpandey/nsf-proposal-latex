%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

abstract = {The proliferation of Big Data systems and namely NoSQL databases has resulted in a tremendous heterogeneity in its offerings. It has become increasingly difficult to compare and select the most optimal NoSQL storage technology. Current benchmark efforts, such as the Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB), evaluate simple read and write operations on a primary key. However, while YCSB has become the de-facto benchmark solution for practitioners and NoSQL vendors, it is lacking in capabilities to extensively evaluate specific NoSQL solutions.In this paper, we present a systematic survey of current NoSQL benchmarks, in which we identify a clear gap in benchmarking more advanced workloads (e.g. nested document search) for features specific to NoSQL database families (e.g. document stores). Secondly, based on our survey, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the different benchmark design approaches, and argue in favor of a benchmark suite that targets specific families of NoSQL databases yet still allows overall comparison of databases in terms of their commonalities.},

abstract = {Modern data-centric flows in the telecommunications industry require real time analytical processing over a rapidly changing and large dataset. The traditional approach of separating OLTP and OLAP workloads cannot satisfy this requirement. Instead, a new class of integrated solutions for handling hybrid workloads is needed. This paper presents an industrial use case and a novel architecture that integrates key-value-based event processing and SQL-based analytical processing on the same distributed store while minimizing the total cost of ownership. Our approach combines several well-known techniques such as shared scans, delta processing, a PAX-fashioned storage layout, and an interleaving of scanning and delta merging in a completely new way. Performance experiments show that our system scales out linearly with the number of servers. For instance, our system sustains event streams of 100,000 events per second while simultaneously processing 100 ad-hoc analytical queries per second, using a cluster of 12 commodity servers. In doing so, our system meets all response time goals of our telecommunication customers; that is, 10 milliseconds per event and 100 milliseconds for an ad-hoc analytical query. Moreover, our system beats commercial competitors by a factor of 2.5 in analytical and two orders of magnitude in update performance.},

Many companies have developed their own systems; we have a realtime data processing ecosystem at Facebook that handles hundreds of Gigabytes per second across hundreds of data pipelines.Many decisions must be made while designing a realtime stream processing system. In this paper, we identify five important design decisions that affect their ease of use, performance, fault tolerance, scalability, and correctness. We compare the alternative choices for each decision and contrast what we built at Facebook to other published systems.Our main decision was targeting seconds of latency, not milliseconds. Seconds is fast enough for all of the use cases we support and it allows us to use a persistent message bus for data transport. This data transport mechanism then paved the way for fault tolerance, scalability, and multiple options for correctness in our stream processing systems Puma, Swift, and Stylus.We then illustrate how our decisions and systems satisfy our requirements for multiple use cases at Facebook. Finally, we reflect on the lessons we learned as we built and operated these systems.},

This platform permits high performance OLAP with massive scale-out capabilities, while concurrently allowing OLTP workloads. This dual capability enables analytics over real-time changing data and allows fine grained user-specified service level agreements (SLAs) on data freshness. We advocate the decoupling of core database components such as query processing, concurrency control, and persistence, a design choice made possible by advances in high-throughput low-latency networks and storage devices. We provide full ACID guarantees and build on a logical timestamp mechanism to provide MVCC-based snapshot isolation, while not requiring synchronous updates of replicas. Instead, we use asynchronous update propagation guaranteeing consistency with timestamp validation.We provide a view into the design and development of a large scale data management platform for real-time analytics, driven by the needs of modern enterprise customers.},

year = {2020},
isbn = {9781939133120},
publisher = {USENIX Association},
address = {USA},
abstract = {Persistent key-value stores are widely used as building blocks in today's IT infrastructure for managing and storing large amounts of data. However, studies of characterizing real-world workloads for key-value stores are limited due to the lack of tracing/analyzing tools and the difficulty of collecting traces in operational environments. In this paper, we first present a detailed characterization of workloads from three typical RocksDB production use cases at Facebook: UDB (a MySQL storage layer for social graph data), ZippyDB (a distributed key-value store), and UP2X (a distributed key-value store for AI/ML services). These characterizations reveal several interesting findings: first, that the distribution of key and value sizes are highly related to the use cases/applications; second, that the accesses to key-value pairs have a good locality and follow certain special patterns; and third, that the collected performance metrics show a strong diurnal pattern in the UDB, but not the other two.We further discover that although the widely used key-value benchmark YCSB provides various workload configurations and key-value pair access distribution models, the YCSB-triggered workloads for underlying storage systems are still not close enough to the workloads we collected due to ignorance of key-space localities. To address this issue, we propose a key-range based modeling and develop a benchmark that can better emulate the workloads of real-world key-value stores. This benchmark can synthetically generate more precise key-value queries that represent the reads and writes of key-value stores to the underlying storage system.},

abstract = {In this paper, we examine the design tradeoffs of existing in-memory data structures of a state-of-the-art key-value store. We observe that no data structures provide both fast point-accesses and consistent ranged- retrievals, and naive amalgamations of existing structures fail to get the best of both worlds. Furthermore, our experiments reveal a performance anomaly when increasing the memory size: as more key-value pairs are maintained in memory, the shortcomings of the data structures exacerbate. To address the above problems, we present TeksDB, a fast and consistent key-value store with a novel in-memory data structure, which effciently handles both point- and ranged- accesses at a modest increase in memory footprint. Our evaluation demonstrates that TeksDB outperforms RocksDB by 3.6\texttimes{}, 9\texttimes{}, and 4.5\texttimes{} for get, scan, and range_query, respectively. The effectiveness of TeksDB extends to real-world workloads, achieving up to 3.3\texttimes{} speedup for YCSB.},

abstract = {Applications of key-value (KV-)storage often exhibit high spatial locality, such as when many data items have identical composite key prefixes. This prevalent access pattern is underused by the ubiquitous LSM design underlying high-throughput KV-stores today.We present EvenDB, a general-purpose persistent KV-store optimized for spatially-local workloads. EvenDB combines spatial data partitioning with LSM-like batch I/O. It achieves high throughput, ensures consistency under multi-threaded access, and reduces write amplification.In experiments with real-world data from a large analytics platform, EvenDB outperforms the state-of-the-art. E.g., on a 256GB production dataset, EvenDB ingests data 4.4X faster than RocksDB and reduces write amplification by nearly 4X. In traditional YCSB workloads lacking spatial locality, EvenDB is on par with RocksDB and significantly better than other open-source solutions we explored.},

abstract = {Modern NVMe solid state drives offer significantly higher bandwidth and lower latency than prior storage devices. Current key-value stores struggle to fully utilize the bandwidth of such devices. This paper presents SplinterDB, a new key-value store explicitly designed for NVMe solid-state-drives.SplinterDB is designed around a novel data structure (the STBε-tree) that exposes I/O and CPU concurrency and reduces write amplification without sacrificing query performance. STBε-tree combines ideas from log-structured merge trees and Bε-trees to reduce write amplification and CPU costs of compaction. The SplinterDB memtable and cache are designed to be highly concurrent and to reduce cache misses.We evaluate SplinterDB on a number of micro- and macro-benchmarks, and show that SplinterDB outperforms RocksDB, a state-of-the-art key-value store, by a factor of 6-10\texttimes{} on insertions and 2-2.6\texttimes{} on point queries, while matching RocksDB on small range queries. Furthermore, SplinterDB reduces write amplification by 2\texttimes{} compared to RocksDB.},
