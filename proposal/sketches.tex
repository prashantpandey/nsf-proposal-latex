\prashant{Given a fastq file containing raw sequencing reads. Can we quickly and space-efficiently (maybe sublinear time and space?) estimate a frequency distribution for \kmers for a given $k$?
Specifically, we are interested in estimating the total number of \kmers, the total number of distinct \kmers, the total number of \kmers with a given count C?}
