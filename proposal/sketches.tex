\prashant{Given a fastq file containing raw sequencing reads. Can we quickly and space-efficiently (maybe sublinear time and space?) estimate a frequency distribution for \kmers for a given $k$?
Specifically, we are interested in estimating the total number of \kmers, the total number of distinct \kmers, the total number of \kmers with a given count C?}

\begin{rproblem}
Prove the lower-bound for the amount of file required to be read to estimate the cardinality of \kmer in a raw sequence file.

\begin{rproblem}
Build a GPU-enabled cardinality estimator for \kmers in raw sequencing samples (genomic, transcriptomic, metageomic).
\end{rproblem}

\begin{rproblem}
Prove a communication lower bound to compute the similarity score for two set of \kmers in a distributed setting.
