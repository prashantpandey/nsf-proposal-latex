@inproceedings{AgarwalCh89,
	abstract = { Shared-memory multiprocessors commonly use shared
		  variables for synchronization. Our simulations of real
		  parallel applications show that large-scale cache-coherent
		  multiprocessors suffer significant amounts of invalidation
		  traffic due to synchronization. Large multiprocessors that
		  do not cache synchronization variables are often more
		  severely impacted. If this synchronization traffic is not
		  reduced or managed adequately, synchronization references
		  can cause severe congestion in the network. We propose a
		  class of adaptive back-off methods that do not use any
		  extra hardware and can significantly reduce the memory
		  traffic to synchronization variables. These methods use
		  synchronization state to reduce polling of synchronization
		  variables. Our simulations show that when the number of
		  processors participating in a barrier synchronization is
		  small compared to the time of arrival of the processors,
		  reductions of 20 percent to over 95 percent in
		  synchronization traffic can be achieved at no extra cost.
		  In other situations adaptive backoff techniques result in a
		  tradeoff between reduced network accesses and increased
		  processor idle time. },

	abstract = {In practice, almost all dynamic systems require decisions
		  to be made on-line, without full knowledge of their future
		  impact on the system. A general model for the processing of
		  sequences of tasks is introduced, and a general on-line
		  decision algorithm is developed. It is shown that, for an
		  important class of special cases, this algorithm is optimal
		  among all on-line algorithms.\par Specifically, a task
		  system $(S,d)$ for processing sequences of tasks consists
		  of a set $S$ of states and a cost matrix $d$ where $d(i,
		  j)$ is the cost of changing from state $i$ to state $j$ (we
		  assume that $d$ satisfies the triangle inequality and all
		  diagonal entries are 0). The cost of processing a given
		  task depends on the state of the system. A schedule for a
		  sequence $T^{1}, T^{2},\ldots{}, T^{k}$ of tasks is a
		  sequence $s_{1}, s_{2},\ldots{}, s_{k}$ of states where
		  $s_{i}$ is the state in which $T^{i}$ is processed; the
		  cost of a schedule is the sum of all task processing costs
		  and the state transition costs incurred.\par An on-line
		  scheduling algorithm is one that chooses $s_{i}$ only
		  knowing $T^{1}, T^{2}, \ldots{}, T^{i}$. Such an algorithm
		  is $w$-competitive if, on any input task sequence, its cost
		  is within an additive constant of $w$ times the optimal
		  offline schedule cost. The competitive ratio $w(S, d)$ is
		  the infimum $w$ for which there is a $w$-competitive
		  on-line scheduling algorithm for $(S,d)$. It is shown that
		  $w(S, d) = 2|S|-1$ {\em for every task system\/} in which
		  $d$ is symmetric, and $w(S, d) = O(|S|^{2})$ for every task
		  system. Finally, randomized on-line scheduling algorithms
		  are introduced. It is shown that for the uniform task
		  system (in which $d(i,j) = 1$ for all $i,j$), the expected
		  competitive ratio $\bar{w}(S,d) = O(\log|S|)$.},

	abstract = {We propose a version of cache oblivious search trees which
          is simpler than the previous proposal of Bender, Demaine
          and Farach-Colton and has the same complexity bounds. In
          particular, our data structure avoids the use of weight
          balanced B-trees, and can be implemented as just a single
          array of data elements, without the use of pointers. The
          structure also improves space utilization. \par For storing
          n elements, our proposal uses $(1+\epsilon) n$ times the
          element size of memory, and performs searches in worst case
          $O(log_B n)$ memory transfers, updates in amortized
          $O((log_2 n)/(\epsilon B))$ memory transfers, and range
          queries in worst case $O(\log_B n + k/B)$ memory transfers,
          where $k$ is the size of the output. \par The basic idea of
          our data structure is to maintain a dynamic binary tree of
          height $\log n+O(1)$ using existing methods, embed this
          tree in a static binary tree, which in turn is embedded in
          an array in a cache oblivious fashion, using the van Emde
          Boas layout of Prokop. \par We also investigate the
          practicality of cache obliviousness in the area of search
          trees, by providing an empirical comparison of different
          methods for laying out a search tree in memory.},

@article{Franklin79,
	abstract = {[from the introduction] An important problem in database
		  processing is the manipulation of a set of $N$ records with
		  keys chosen from a key space of cardinality much greater
		  than $N$. This means that a bit map of the set is
		  infeasible. Some typical operations include the following:
		  (1) finding the record with a given key, if it exists; (2)
		  finding the record with the next higher (or lower) key than
		  a given record, whose location we may or may not already
		  know; (3) finding all the records with keys in a certain
		  range; (4) adding a record to the set and (5) deleting a
		  record from the set. \par This paper presents a new data
		  structure, the padded list, that does all the above
		  operations in expected time $T=\theta(\log\text{}\log N)$
		  if the record keys are drawn independently from a known
		  probability distribution. However, if the keys are selected
		  by an adversary, the worst case time for padded lists, like
		  hash tables, is $T=\theta(N)$.},

Three synergies: 1) (asynchronous) signals are only kernel-supported notification; 2) tolerance of threads being terminated (fail-stopped) in the middle of ``system library'' code, such as handling a page fault, etc; 3) isolation of synchronization from scheduling and thread deletion allows modular and reliable system design. Implementation uses: atomic DCAS, type-stable memory management, and contention-minimizing data structures.},

	abstract = {We study a data structure $\bold L$ referred to variously
		  as a padded list, a controlled density array or a sparse
		  table, containing records $\{R\sb i\}$ each uniquely
		  identified by a key $\{k(R\sb i)\}$. The data structure
		  $\bold L$ is required to support the operations
		  $\roman{Search}(\bold L, k)$, $\roman{Insert}(\bold L, k)$
		  and $\roman{Delete}(\bold L, k)$ to search, insert and
		  delete a record with key $k$. To optimize
		  $\roman{Search}(\bold L, k)$, records are stored with their
		  keys in sorted order. If the order of the keys is to be
		  maintained under insertion, records currently in $\bold L$
		  must be moved to free space. To improve the efficiency of
		  $\roman{Insert}(\bold L, k)$, records are stored in a
		  circular buffer with `gaps' so that insertion necessitates
		  moving only records up to the next gap. The array is
		  expanded and contracted during a sequence of insertions and
		  deletions depending upon the current number of gaps. In
		  this paper we assess the amount of work required to insert
		  a sequence of records.},

		  Manasse et al. [1988] conjectured that the competitive
		  ratio for the $k$-server problem is exactly $k$ (it is
		  trivially at least $k$); previously the best-known upper
		  bound was exponential in $k$. Our proof involves three

		  quasiconvexity to characterize the configuration that
		  achieve maximum increase of the work function, and a {\em
		  potential function\/} that exploits the duality lemma.},

There are two kinds of locks: read locks and write locks.'' Nested actions: ``To keep the locking rules simple, we do not allow a parent action to run concurrently with its children.'' ``In addition to nesting subactions inside other actions, it is sometimes useful to start a new top action inside another action. Such a `nested' top action, unlike a subaction, has no special privileges relative to its parent; for example, it is not able to read an atomic object modified by its parent. Furthermore, the commit of a nested top action is not relative to its parent; its versions are written to stable storage, and its locks are released, just as for normal top actions. Nested top actions are useful for benevolent side effects.''},

		  strategy for distribution sort that is applicable to a wide
		  variety of parallel disks and parallel memory hierarchies
		  with both single and parallel processors. The simplest
		  application of the strategy is an optimal deterministic
		  algorithm for external sorting with multiple disks and
		  parallel processors. In each input/output (I/O) operation,
		  each of the $D \geq 1$ disks can simultaneously transfer a
		  block of $B$ contiguous records. Our two measures of
		  performance are the number of I/Os and the amount of work
		  done by the CPU(s); our algorithm is simultaneously optimal
		  for both measures. We also show how to sort
		  deterministically in parallel memory hierarchies. When the
		  processors are interconnected by any sort of a PRAM, our
		  algorithms are optimal for all parallel memory hierarchies;
		  when the interconnection network is a hypercube, our
		  algorithms are either optimal or best-known.},

		  invention is that each memory module has a scratch buffer
		  cache. The processor can write several items to the buffer,
		  and the tell the memory module to commit them. To commit,
		  the memory module takes the items from the buffer and
		  writes them to the memory. To abort, the memory module
		  takes the old values from the buffer and writs them to
		  memory. Even if the processor fails in the middle, the
		  memory will be consistent.

		  Some differences from our work: It is not clear how to make
		  transactions that involve memory locations in two different
		  memory modules. Also, it is not clear how to make
		  transactions that are too big to fit in the scratch
		  buffer.},

	abstract = {On-line algorithms service sequences of requests, one at a
		  time, without knowing future requests. We compare their
		  performance with the performance of algorithms that
		  generate the sequences and service them as well. In many
		  settings, on-line algorithms perform almost as well as
		  optimal off-line algorithms, by using statistics about
		  previous requests in the sequences. Since remembering such
		  information may be expensive, we consider the use of
		  randomization to eliminate memory. In the process, we
		  devise and study performance measures for randomized
		  on-line algorithms. We develop and analyze memoryless
		  randomized on-line algorithms for the cacheing problem and
		  its generalizations.},

		  step of the PRAM is emulated in time O(log N) with high
		  probability, using first-in-first-out queues of size O(1)
		  at each node. The only use of randomization is in selecting
		  a hash function to distribute the shared address space of
		  the PRAM onto the nodes of the butterfly. The routing
		  itself is both deterministic and oblivious, and messages
		  are combined without the use of associative memories or
		  explicit sorting. Besides being optimal, the algorithm has
		  the advantage of extreme simplicity and is easy to use in

@incollection{ShriverNo96,
	abstract = {Problems whose data are too large to fit into main memory
		  are called {\it out-of-core} problems. Out-of-core
		  parallel-I/O algorithms can handle much larger problems
		  than in-memory variants and have much better performance
		  than single-device variants. However, they are not commonly
		  used---partly because the understanding of them is not
		  widespread. Yet such algorithms ought to be growing in
		  importance because they address the needs of users with
		  ever-growing problem sizes and ever-increasing performance
		  needs. \par This paper addresses this lack of understanding
		  by presenting an introduction to the data-transfer models
		  on which most of the out-of-core parallel-I/O algorithms
		  are based, with particular emphasis on the Parallel Disk
		  Model. Sample algorithms are discussed to demonstrate the
		  paradigms (algorithmic techniques) used with these models.
		  \par Our aim is to provide insight into both the paradigms
		  and the particular algorithms described, thereby also
		  providing a background for understanding a range of related
		  solutions. It is hoped that this background would enable
		  the appropriate selection of existing algorithms and the
		  development of new ones for current and future out-of-core
		  problems.},

	abstract = {We provide the first optimal algorithms in terms of the
		  number of input/outputs (I/Os) required between internal
		  memory and multiple secondary storage devices for the
		  problems of sorting, FFT, matrix transposition, standard
		  matrix multiplication, and related problems. Our two-level
		  memory model is new and gives a realistic treatment of {\em
		  parallel block transfer}, in which during a single~I/O each
		  of the $P$ secondary storage devices can simultaneously
		  transfer a contiguous block of $B$ records. The model
		  pertains to a large-scale uniprocessor system or parallel
		  multiprocessor system with $P$ disks. In addition, the
		  sorting, FFT, permutation network, and standard matrix
		  multiplication algorithms are typically optimal in terms of
		  the amount of internal processing time. The difficulty in
		  developing optimal algorithms is to cope with the
		  partitioning of memory into $P$~separate physical devices.
		  Our algorithms' performance can be significantly better
		  than those obtained by the well-known but nonoptimal
		  technique of disk striping. Our optimal sorting algorithm
		  is randomized, but practical; the probability of using more
		  than $\ell$ times the optimal number of I/Os is
		  exponentially small in $\ell (\log \ell) \log (M/B)$, where
		  $M$ is the internal memory size.},

As an alternative, a cuckoo filter may need less space than a Bloom filter and it is faster. Chazelle et al. proposed a generalization of the Bloom filter called the Bloomier filter. Dietzfelbinger and Pagh described a variation on the Bloomier filter that can answer approximate membership queries over immutable sets. It has never been tested empirically, to our knowledge. We review an efficient implementation of their approach, which we call the xor filter. We find that xor filters can be faster than Bloom and cuckoo filters while using less memory. We further show that a more compact version of xor filters (xor+) can use even less space than highly compact alternatives (e.g., Golomb-compressed sequences) while providing speeds competitive with Bloom filters.},

abstract = {Phase Change Memory (PCM) is emerging as an attractive alternative to Dynamic Random
Access Memory (DRAM) in building data-intensive computing systems. PCM offers read/write
performance asymmetry that makes it necessary to revisit the design of in-memory applications.In
this paper, we focus on in-memory hash tables, a family of data structures with wide
applicability. We evaluate several popular hash-table designs to understand their
performance under PCM. We find that for write-heavy workloads the designs that achieve
best performance for PCMdiffer from the ones that are best for DRAM, and that designs
achieving a high load factor also cause a high number of memory writes. Finally, we
propose PFHT, a PCM-Friendly Hash Table which presents a cuckoo hashing variant that
is tailored to PCM characteristics, and offers a better trade-off between performance,
the amount of writes generated, and the expected load factor than any of the existing
DRAM-based implementations.},

abstract = {Non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies as persistent memory are promising candidates
to complement or replace DRAM for building future memory systems, due to having the
advantages of high density, low power, and non-volatility. In main memory systems,
hashing index structures are fundamental building blocks to provide fast query responses.
However, hashing index structures originally designed for dynamic random access memory
(DRAM) become inefficient for persistent memory due to new challenges including hardware
limitations of NVM and the requirement of data consistency. To address these challenges,
this article proposes level hashing, a write-optimized and high-performance hashing
index scheme with low-overhead consistency guarantee and cost-efficient resizing.
Level hashing provides a sharing-based two-level hash table, which achieves constant-scale
worst-case time complexity for search, insertion, deletion, and update operations,
and rarely incurs extra NVM writes. To guarantee the consistency with low overhead,
level hashing leverages log-free consistency schemes for deletion, insertion, and
resizing operations, and an opportunistic log-free scheme for update operation. To
cost-efficiently resize this hash table, level hashing leverages an in-place resizing
scheme that only needs to rehash 1/3 of buckets instead of the entire table to expand
a hash table and rehash 2/3 of buckets to shrink a hash table, thus significantly
improving the resizing performance and reducing the number of rehashed buckets. Extensive
experimental results show that the level hashing speeds up insertions by 1.4\texttimes{}−3.0\texttimes{},
updates by 1.2\texttimes{}−2.1\texttimes{}, expanding by over 4.3\texttimes{}, and shrinking by over 1.4\texttimes{} while maintaining
high search and deletion performance compared with start-of-the-art hashing schemes.},

abstract = {Persistent memory (PM) is increasingly being leveraged to build hash-based indexing
structures featuring cheap persistence, high performance, and instant recovery, especially
with the recent release of Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory Modules. However, most
of them are evaluated on DRAM-based emulators with unreal assumptions, or focus on
the evaluation of specific metrics with important properties sidestepped. Thus, it
is essential to understand how well the proposed hash indexes perform on real PM and
how they differentiate from each other if a wider range of performance metrics are
considered.To this end, this paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of persistent
hash tables. In particular, we focus on the evaluation of six state-of-the-art hash
tables including Level hashing, CCEH, Dash, PCLHT, Clevel, and SOFT, with real PM
hardware. Our evaluation was conducted using a unified benchmarking framework and
representative workloads. Besides characterizing common performance properties, we
also explore how hardware configurations (such as PM bandwidth, CPU instructions,
and NUMA) affect the performance of PM-based hash tables. With our in-depth analysis,
we identify design trade-offs and good paradigms in prior arts, and suggest desirable
optimizations and directions for the future development of PM-based hash tables.},

abstract = {Volatile media have dominated the realm of main memory on servers and desktop computers
for decades. In 2019, Intel released the Optane Data Center Persistent Memory Module
(DCPMM), which offers the capacity and persistence of block devices while providing
the byte addressability and low latency of DRAM. These new memory modules allow programmers
to develop data structures that can survive in main memory across crashes and power
failures, without relying on secondary power sources such as batteries. This work
presents the design of a persistent memory hash table data structure that incorporates
several features to maximize efficiency: the locks for concurrency control are kept
in volatile DRAM, an embedded memory allocator is used, a parallel table resize operation
is implemented, and a mechanism is provided to incrementally expand the underlying
memory-mapped file. We compare PHPRX experimentally against the Dash persistent memory
hash table published recently by Lu et al., and demonstrate substantial speed-ups
on an Intel Xeon server equipped with genuine Intel Optane DCPMM. Our performance
advantage holds despite PHPRX using a space-efficient incremental approach to expanding
the underlying memory-mapped file, as opposed to the much simpler static allocation
approach used by Dash.},

abstract = {Achieving high performance for concurrent applications on modern multiprocessors remains challenging. Many programmers avoid locking to improve performance, while others replace locks with non-blocking synchronization to protect against deadlock, priority inversion, and convoying. In both cases, dynamic data structures that avoid locking require a memory reclamation scheme that reclaims elements once they are no longer in use. The performance of existing memory reclamation schemes has not been thoroughly evaluated. We conduct the first fair and comprehensive comparison of three recent schemes—quiescent-state-based reclamation, epoch-based reclamation, and hazard-pointer-based reclamation—using a flexible microbenchmark. Our results show that there is no globally optimal scheme. When evaluating lockless synchronization, programmers and algorithm designers should thus carefully consider the data structure, the workload, and the execution environment, each of which can dramatically affect the memory reclamation performance. We discuss the consequences of our results for programmers and algorithm designers. Finally, we describe the use of one scheme, quiescent-state-based reclamation, in the context of an OS kernel—an execution environment which is well suited to this scheme.}

of threads. As more scalable alternatives, concurrent data structures and algorithms
based on widely available, however advanced, atomic operations have been proposed.
These data structures allow for correct and concurrent operations without any locks.
In this paper, we present a new fully lock-free open addressed hash table with a simpler
design than prior published work. We split hash table insertions into two atomic phases:
first inserting a value ignoring other concurrent operations, then in the second phase
resolve any duplicate or conflicting values.Our hash table has a constant and low
memory usage that is less than existing lock-free hash tables at a fill level of 33%
and above. The hash table exhibits good cache locality. Compared to prior art, our
hash table results in 16% and 15% fewer L1 and L2 cache misses respectively, leading
to 21% fewer memory stall cycles. Our experiments show that our hash table scales
close to linearly with the number of threads and outperforms, in throughput, other
lock-free hash tables by 19%.},

The new hopscotch algorithms are based on a novel hopscotch multi-phased probing and displacement technique that has the flavors of chaining, cuckoo hashing, and linear probing, all put together, yet avoids the limitations and overheads of these former approaches. The resulting algorithms provide tables with very low synchronization overheads and high cache hit ratios.",

abstract = {CPHash is a concurrent hash table for multicore processors. CPHash partitions its table across the caches of cores and uses message passing to transfer lookups/inserts to a partition. CPHash's message passing avoids the need for locks, pipelines batches of asynchronous messages, and packs multiple messages into a single cache line transfer. Experiments on a 80-core machine with 2 hardware threads per core show that CPHash has ~1.6x higher throughput than a hash table implemented using fine-grained locks. An analysis shows that CPHash wins because it experiences fewer cache misses and its cache misses are less expensive, because of less contention for the on-chip interconnect and DRAM. CPServer, a key/value cache server using CPHash, achieves ~5% higher throughput than a key/value cache server that uses a hash table with fine-grained locks, but both achieve better throughput and scalability than memcached. The throughput of CPHash and CPServer also scale near-linearly with the number of cores.},
