\noindent \textbf{\large Overview:}\\

\noindent This project will develop theoretically well-founded data structures for modern accelerator hardware, with a focus on GPUs. Specifically, we will develop a compact, dynamic, and distributed data structure library for GPUs.


\noindent \textbf{\large Intellectual Merit:}\\

\noindent Tell reviewers why your project is scientifically interesting.\\

\noindent \textbf{\large Broader Impacts: }\\

\noindent Tell reviewers about other outcomes of your project beyond the science. Ideas include ancillary products, outreach, and more.
