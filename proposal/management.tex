\section{Management and Coordination}

% Every LARGE proposal must contain a clearly labeled "Management and Coordination Plan", which includes: 1) the specific roles of the PI, co-PIs, other senior personnel, and paid consultants at all organizations involved to demonstrate that the project personnel have distinct but complementary expertise at different levels of the hardware/software stack, and in at least four of the program's research areas; 2) how the project will be managed across organizations and expertise; 3) identification of the specific coordination mechanisms that will enable cross-organization and/or cross-expertise scientific integration and achieve synergy within the team; and 4) pointers to the budget line items that support these management and coordination mechanisms.
