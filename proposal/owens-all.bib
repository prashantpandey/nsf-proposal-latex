  abstract      = {{\textcopyright} The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.We
                  present a computational framework for high-performance
                  tensor contractions on GPUs. High-performance is di cult to
                  obtain using existing libraries, especially for many
                  independent contractions where each contraction is very
                  small, e.g., sub-vector/warp in size. However, using our
                  framework to batch contractions plus application-speci cs,
                  we demonstrate close to peak performance results. In
                  particular, to accelerate large scale tensor-formulated
                  high-order nite element method (FEM) simulations, which is
                  the main focus and motivation for this work, we represent
                  contractions as tensor index reordering plus matrix-matrix
                  multiplications (GEMMs). This is a key factor to achieve
                  algorithmically many-fold acceleration (vs. not using it)
                  due to possible reuse of data loaded in fast memory. In
                  addition to using this context knowledge, we design tensor
                  data-structures, tensor algebra interfaces, and new tensor
                  contraction algorithms and implementations to achieve 90+\%
                  of a theoretically derived peak on GPUs. On a K40c GPU for
                  contractions resulting in GEMMs on square matrices of size
                  8 for example, we are 2.8{\texttimes} faster than CUBLAS,
                  and 8.5{\texttimes} faster than MKL on 16 cores of Intel
                  Xeon E5-2670 (Sandy Bridge) 2.60GHz CPUs. Finally, we apply
                  autotuning and code generation techniques to simplify
                  tuning and provide an architecture-aware, user-friendly
                  interface.}

                  Scalable Multi-core Architectures (PLASMA) and Matrix
                  Algebra on GPU and Multics Architectures (MAGMA) are two
                  projects that aims to achieve high performance and
                  portability across a wide range of multi-core architectures
                  and hybrid systems respectively. We present in this
                  document a comparative study of PLASMA's performance
                  against established linear algebra packages and some
                  preliminary results of MAGMA on hybrid multi-core and GPU

  abstract      = {This article presents an optimized algorithm for
                  Nonnegative Tensor Factorization (NTF), implemented in the
                  CUDA (Compute Uniform Device Architecture) framework, that
                  runs on contemporary graphics processors and exploits their
                  massive parallelism. The NTF implementation is primarily
                  targeted for analysis of high-dimensional spectral images,
                  including dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and
                  other tasks related to spectral imaging; however, the
                  algorithm and its implementation are not limited to
                  spectral imaging. The speedups measured on real spectral
                  images are around 60-100{\texttimes} compared to a
                  traditional C implementation compiled with an optimizing
                  compiler. Since common problems in the field of spectral
                  imaging may take hours on a state-of-the-art CPU, the
                  speedup achieved using a graphics card is attractive. The
                  implementation is publicly available in the form of a
                  dynamically linked library, including an interface to
                  MATLAB, and thus may be of help to researchers and
                  engineers using NTF on large problems. {\textcopyright}

                  changes to the GPU architecture (e.g. more caches, more
                  concurrent kernels, better synchronization). As GPUs press
                  further into the general-purpose domain, architects must
                  continue to address the performance of challenging
                  workloads. This paper presents a set of challenge
                  benchmarks and their key performance limitations to help
                  direct future GPU architecture research. Our study shows
                  GPUs must develop multiple innovative architectural
                  techniques to efficiently execute these applications to
                  continue making inroads into general purpose computing.}

                  bandwidth make GPUs ideal candidates for data parallel

  abstract      = {The recently released Rodinia benchmark suite enables
                  users to evaluate heterogeneous systems including both
                  accelerators, such as GPUs, and multicore CPUs. As Rodinia
                  sees higher levels of acceptance, it becomes important that
                  researchers understand this new set of benchmarks,
                  especially in how they differ from previous work. In this
                  paper, we present recent extensions to Rodinia and conduct
                  a detailed characterization of the Rodinia benchmarks
                  (including performance results on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX480,
                  the first product released based on the Fermi
                  architecture). We also compare and contrast Rodinia with
                  Parsec to gain insights into the similarities and
                  differences of the two benchmark collections; we apply
                  principal component analysis to analyze the application
                  space coverage of the two suites. Our analysis shows that
                  many of the workloads in Rodinia and Parsec are
                  complementary, capturing different aspects of certain
                  performance metrics.},

                  implementations for deep learning primitives. Deep learning
                  workloads are computationally intensive, and optimizing the
                  kernels of deep learning workloads is difficult and
                  time-consuming. As parallel architectures evolve, kernels
                  must be reoptimized for new processors, which makes
                  maintaining codebases difficult over time. Similar issues
                  have long been addressed in the HPC community by libraries
                  such as the Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (BLAS).
                  However, there is no analogous library for deep learning.
                  Without such a library, researchers implementing deep
                  learning workloads on parallel processors must create and
                  optimize their own implementations of the main
                  computational kernels, and this work must be repeated as
                  new parallel processors emerge. To address this problem, we
                  have created a library similar in intent to BLAS, with
                  optimized routines for deep learning workloads. Our
                  implementation contains routines for GPUs, and similarly to
                  the BLAS library, could be implemented for other platforms.
                  The library is easy to integrate into existing frameworks,
                  and provides optimized performance and memory usage. For
                  example, integrating cuDNN into Caffe, a popular framework
                  for convolutional networks, improves performance by 36\% on
                  a standard model while also reducing memory consumption.}

  abstract      = {Scaling up deep learning algorithms has been shown to lead
                  to increased performance in benchmark tasks and to enable
                  discovery of complex high-level features. Recent efforts to
                  train extremely large networks (with over 1 billion
                  parameters) have relied on cloud-like computing
                  infrastructure and thousands of CPU cores. In this paper,
                  we present technical details and results from our own
                  system based on Commodity Off-The-Shelf High Performance
                  Computing (COTS HPC) technology: a cluster of GPU servers
                  with Infiniband interconnects and MPI. Our system is able
                  to train 1 billion parameter networks on just 3 machines in
                  a couple of days, and we show that it can scale to networks
                  with over 11 billion parameters using just 16 machines. As
                  this infrastructure is much more easily marshaled by
                  others, the approach enables much wider-spread research
                  with extremely large neural networks.}

  abstract      = {Accelerating breadth-first search (BFS) can be a
                  compelling value-add given its pervasive deployment. The
                  current state-of-the-art hybrid BFS algorithm selects
                  different traversal directions based on graph properties,
                  thereby, possessing heterogeneous characteristics. Related
                  work has studied this heterogeneous BFS algorithm on
                  homogeneous processors. In recent years heterogeneous
                  processors have become mainstream due to their ability to
                  maximize performance under restrictive thermal budgets.
                  However, current software fails to fully leverage the
                  heterogeneous capabilities of the modern processor, lagging
                  behind hardware advancements. We propose a
                  {\textquotedblleft}hybrid++{\textquotedblright} BFS
                  algorithm for an accelerated processing unit (APU), a
                  heterogeneous processor which fuses the CPU and GPU cores
                  on a single die. Hybrid++ leverages the strength of CPUs
                  and GPUs for serial and data-parallel execution,
                  respectively, to carefully partition BFS by selecting the
                  appropriate execution-core and graph-traversal direction
                  for every search iteration. Our results illustrate that on
                  a variety of graphs ranging from social- to road-networks,
                  hybrid++ yields a speedup of up to 2{\texttimes} compared
                  to the multithreaded hybrid algorithm. Execution of
                  hybrid++ on the APU is also 2.3{\texttimes} more energy
                  efficient than that on a discrete GPU. View full abstract}

                  achieve 5 sec one-way communication latency and up to
                  50Gbit/sec transfer bandwidth for messages from 16KB and
                  larger between K40c NVIDIA GPUs across the network.
                  Moreover, GPUrdma outperforms the CPU RDMA for smaller
                  packets ranging from 2 to 1024 bytes by factor of
                  4:5{\texttimes} thanks to greater parallelism of transfer
                  requests enabled by highly parallel GPU hardware. We use
                  GPUrdma to implement a subset of the global address space
                  programming interface (GPI) for point-to-point asynchronous
                  RDMA messaging. We demonstrate our preliminary results
                  using two simple applications - ping-pong and a
                  multi-matrix-vector product with constant matrix and
                  multiple vectors - each running on two different machines
                  connected by Infiniband. Our basic pingpong implementation
                  achieves 5\% higher performance than the baseline using
                  GPI-2. The improved ping-pong implementation with
                  per-threadblock communication overlap enables further 20\%
                  improvement. The multi-matrix-vector product is up to 4:5
                  {\texttimes} faster thanks to higher throughput for small
                  messages and the ability to keep the matrix in fast GPU
                  shared memory while receiving new inputs. GPUrdma prototype
                  is not yet suitable for production systems due to hardware
                  constraints in the current generation of NVIDIA GPUs which
                  we discuss in detail. However, our results highlight the
                  great potential of GPU-side native networking, and
                  encourage further research toward scalable,
                  high-performance, heterogeneous networking infrastructure.}

                  Collection, a large and actively growing set of sparse
                  matrices that arise in real applications. The Collection is
                  widely used by the numerical linear algebra community for
                  the development and performance evaluation of sparse matrix
                  algorithms. It allows for robust and repeatable
                  experiments: robust because performance results with
                  artificially generated matrices can be misleading, and
                  repeatable because matrices are curated and made publicly
                  available in many formats. Its matrices cover a wide
                  spectrum of domains, include those arising from problems
                  with underlying 2D or 3D geometry (as structural

                  electromagnetics, semiconductor devices, thermodynamics,
                  materials, acoustics, computer graphics/vision,
                  robotics/kinematics, and other discretizations) and those

                  single-source shortest path problem on road networks and
                  graphs with low highway dimension. After a quick
                  preprocessing phase, we can compute all distances from a
                  given source in the graph with essentially a linear sweep
                  over all vertices. Because this sweep is independent of the
                  source, we are able to reorder vertices in advance to
                  exploit locality. Moreover, our algorithm takes advantage
                  of features of modern CPU architectures, such as SSE and
                  multiple cores. Compared to Dijkstra's algorithm, our
                  method needs fewer operations, has better locality, and is
                  better able to exploit parallelism at multi-core and
                  instruction levels. We gain additional speedup when
                  implementing our algorithm on a GPU, where it is up to
                  three orders of magnitude faster than Dijkstra's algorithm
                  on a high-end CPU. This makes applications based on
                  all-pairs shortest-paths practical for continental-sized
                  road networks. Several algorithms, such as computing the
                  graph diameter, arc flags, or exact reaches, can be greatly
                  accelerated by our method.}

  abstract      = {Applying high level parallel runtimes to data/compute
                  intensive applications is becoming increasingly common. The
                  simplicity of the MapReduce programming model and the
                  availability of open source MapReduce runtimes such as
                  Hadoop, are attracting more users to the MapReduce
                  programming model. Recently, Microsoft has released
                  DryadLINQ for academic use, allowing users to experience a
                  new programming model and a runtime that is capable of
                  performing large scale data/compute intensive analyses. In
                  this paper, we present our experience in applying DryadLINQ
                  for a series of scientific data analysis applications,
                  identify their mapping to the DryadLINQ programming model,
                  and compare their performances with Hadoop implementations
                  of the same applications.}

                  arithmetic operations than transfers of a single word to or
                  from global memory. Hence, many GPU kernels are limited by
                  memory bandwidth and cannot exploit the arithmetic power of
                  GPUs. However, the memory locality can be often improved by
                  kernel fusion when a sequence of kernels is executed and
                  some kernels in this sequence share data. In this paper, we
                  show how kernels performing map, reduce or their nested
                  combinations can be fused automatically by our
                  source-to-source compiler. To demonstrate the usability of
                  the compiler, we have implemented several BLAS-1 and BLAS-2
                  routines and show how the performance of their sequences
                  can be improved by fusions. Compared to similar sequences
                  using CUBLAS, our compiler is able to generate code that is
                  up to 2.61x faster for the examples tested.}

  abstract      = {The multiplication of a sparse matrix by a dense vector
                  (SpMV) is a centerpiece of scientific computing
                  applications: it is the essential kernel for the solution
                  of sparse linear systems and sparse eigenvalue problems by
                  iterative methods. The efficient implementation of the
                  sparse matrix-vector multiplication is therefore crucial
                  and has been the subject of an immense amount of research,
                  with interest renewed with every major new trend in
                  high-performance computing architectures. The introduction
                  of General-Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs) is no
                  exception, and many articles have been devoted to this
                  problem.With this article, we provide a review of the
                  techniques for implementing the SpMV kernel on GPGPUs that
                  have appeared in the literature of the last few years. We
                  discuss the issues and tradeoffs that have been encountered
                  by the various researchers, and a list of solutions,
                  organized in categories according to common features. We
                  also provide a performance comparison across different
                  GPGPU models and on a set of test matrices coming from
                  various application domains.},

  abstract      = {The global scheduler of a current GPU distributes thread
                  blocks to symmetric multiprocessors (SM), which schedule
                  threads for execution with the granularity of a warp.
                  Threads in a warp execute the same code path in lockstep,
                  which potentially leads to a large amount of wasted cycles
                  for divergent control flow. In order to overcome this
                  general issue of SIMT architectures, we propose techniques
                  to relax divergence on the fly within a computation kernel
                  in order to achieve a much higher total utilization of
                  processing cores. We propose techniques for branch and loop
                  divergence (which may also be combined) switching to
                  suitable tasks during a GPU kernel run every time
                  divergence occurs. Our newly introduced techniques can
                  easily be applied to arbitrary iterative algorithms and we
                  evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our approach
                  exemplarily via synthetic and real world applications.},

                  current GPUs employ a per-warp (or per-wavefront) stack to
                  manage divergent control flow, it incurs decreased
                  efficiency for applications with nested, data-dependent
                  control flow. In this paper, we propose and evaluate the
                  benefits of extending the sharing of resources in a block
                  of warps, already used for scratchpad memory, to exploit
                  control flow locality among threads (where such sharing may
                  at first seem detrimental). In our proposal, warps within a
                  thread block share a common block-wide stack for divergence
                  handling. At a divergent branch, threads are compacted into
                  new warps in hardware. Our simulation results show that
                  this compaction mechanism provides an average speedup of
                  22\% over a baseline per-warp, stack-based reconvergence
                  mechanism, and 17\% versus dynamic warp formation on a set
                  of CUDA applications that suffer significantly from control
                  flow divergence.},

  abstract      = {Scientific workloads have traditionally exploited high
                  levels of sparsity to accelerate computation and reduce
                  memory requirements. While deep neural networks can be made
                  sparse, achieving practical speedups on GPUs is difficult
                  because these applications have relatively moderate levels
                  of sparsity that are not sufficient for existing sparse
                  kernels to outperform their dense counterparts. In this
                  work, we study sparse matrices from deep learning
                  applications and identify favorable properties that can be
                  exploited to accelerate computation. Based on these
                  insights, we develop high-performance GPU kernels for two
                  sparse matrix operations widely applicable in neural
                  networks: sparse matrix-dense matrix multiplication and
                  sampled dense-dense matrix multiplication. Our kernels
                  reach 27\% of single-precision peak on Nvidia V100 GPUs.
                  Using our kernels, we demonstrate sparse Transformer and
                  MobileNet models that achieve 1.2--2.1X speedups and up to
                  12.8X memory savings without sacrificing accuracy.},

  abstract      = {Cloud computing has demonstrated that processing very
                  large datasets over commodity clusters can be done simply,
                  given the right programming model and infrastructure. In
                  this paper, we describe the design and implementation of
                  the Sector storage cloud and the Sphere compute cloud. By
                  contrast with the existing storage and compute clouds,
                  Sector can manage data not only within a data centre, but
                  also across geographically distributed data centres.
                  Similarly, the Sphere compute cloud supports user-defined
                  functions (UDFs) over data both within and across data
                  centres. As a special case, MapReduce-style programming can
                  be implemented in Sphere by using a Map UDF followed by a
                  Reduce UDF. We describe some experimental studies comparing
                  Sector/Sphere and Hadoop using the Terasort benchmark. In
                  these studies, Sector is approximately twice as fast as
                  Hadoop. Sector/Sphere is open source.}

  abstract      = {We present a state-of-the-art speech recognition system
                  developed using end-to-end deep learning. Our architecture
                  is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems,
                  which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines;
                  these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when
                  used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does
                  not need hand-designed components to model background
                  noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead
                  directly learns a function that is robust to such effects.
                  We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept
                  of a "phoneme." Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN
                  training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set
                  of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to
                  efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for
                  training. Our system, called DeepSpeech, outperforms
                  previously published results on the widely studied
                  Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.5\% error on the full
                  test set. DeepSpeech also handles challenging noisy
                  environments better than widely used, state-of-the-art
                  commercial speech systems.}

                  multicore nodes for a significant portion of overall system

                  cannot exploit multiple cores beyond running addition MPI

                  algorithms requirements and software design related to
                  effective use of scalable multicore computers. In
                  particular, we focus on important issues for library
                  research and development, making recommendations for how to
                  effectively develop libraries for future scalable computer

                  introduce an online tensor decomposition based approach for
                  two latent variable modeling problems namely, (1) community
                  detection, in which we learn the latent communities that
                  the social actors in social networks belong to, and (2)
                  topic modeling, in which we infer hidden topics of text
                  articles. We consider decomposition of moment tensors using
                  stochastic gradient descent. We conduct optimization of
                  multilinear operations in SGD and avoid directly forming
                  the tensors, to save computational and storage costs. We
                  present optimized algorithm in two platforms. Our GPU-based
                  implementation exploits the parallelism of SIMD
                  architectures to allow for maximum speed-up by a careful
                  optimization of storage and data transfer, whereas our
                  CPU-based implementation uses efficient sparse matrix
                  computations and is suitable for large sparse data sets.
                  For the community detection problem, we demonstrate
                  accuracy and computational efficiency on Facebook, Yelp and
                  DBLP data sets, and for the topic modeling problem, we also
                  demonstrate good performance on the New York Times data
                  set. We compare our results to the state-of-the-art
                  algorithms such as the variational method, and report a
                  gain of accuracy and a gain of several orders of magnitude
                  in the execution time.}

  abstract      = {Tensor algebra is an important computational abstraction
                  that is increasingly used in data analytics, machine
                  learning, engineering, and the physical sciences. However,
                  the number of tensor expressions is unbounded, which makes
                  it hard to develop and optimize libraries. Furthermore, the
                  tensors are often sparse (most components are zero), which
                  means the code has to traverse compressed formats. To
                  support programmers we have developed taco, a code
                  generation tool that generates dense, sparse, and mixed
                  kernels from tensor algebra expressions. This paper
                  describes the taco web and command-line tools and discusses
                  the benefits of a code generator over a traditional
                  library. See also the demo video at

  abstract      = {MOTIVATION:Data clustering techniques are an essential
                  component of a good data analysis toolbox. Many current
                  bioinformatics applications are inherently compute-intense
                  and work with very large datasets. Sequential algorithms
                  are inadequate for providing the necessary performance. For
                  this reason, we have created Clustering Algorithms for
                  Massively Parallel Architectures, Including GPU Nodes
                  (CAMPAIGN), a central resource for data clustering
                  algorithms and tools that are implemented specifically for
                  execution on massively parallel processing architectures.
                  RESULTS:CAMPAIGN is a library of data clustering algorithms
                  and tools, written in 'C for CUDA' for Nvidia GPUs. The
                  library provides up to two orders of magnitude speed-up
                  over respective CPU-based clustering algorithms and is
                  intended as an open-source resource. New modules from the
                  community will be accepted into the library and the layout
                  of it is such that it can easily be extended to promising
                  future platforms such as OpenCL. AVAILABILITY:Releases of
                  the CAMPAIGN library are freely available for download

                  clustering, called Kps-means, that achieves high
                  performance with near-full occupancy compute kernels
                  without imposing limits on the number of dimensions and
                  data points permitted as input, thus combining flexibility
                  with high degrees of parallelism and efficiency. As a key
                  element to performance improvement, we introduce parallel
                  sorting as data preprocessing and updating steps. Our final
                  implementation for Nvidia GPUs achieves speedups of up to
                  200-fold over CPU reference code and of up to three orders
                  of magnitude when compared with popular numerical software
                  packages}

  abstract      = {Tensor methods have gained increasingly attention from
                  various applications, including machine learning, quantum
                  chemistry, healthcare analytics, social network analysis,
                  data mining, and signal processing, to name a few. Sparse
                  tensors and their algorithms become critical to further
                  improve the performance of these methods and enhance the
                  interpretability of their output. This work presents a
                  sparse tensor algorithm benchmark suite (PASTA) for single-
                  and multi-core CPUs. To the best of our knowledge, this is
                  the first benchmark suite for sparse tensor world. PASTA
                  targets on: 1) helping application users to evaluate
                  different computer systems using its representative
                  computational workloads; 2) providing insights to better
                  utilize existed computer architecture and systems and
                  inspiration for the future design. This benchmark suite
                  will be publicly released.},

  abstract      = {Compressed sparse row (CSR) is a frequently used format
                  for sparse matrix storage. However, the state-of-the-art
                  CSR-based sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) imple-
                  mentations on CUDA-enabled GPUs do not exhibit very high
                  efficiency. This has motivated the development of some
                  alterna- tive storage formats for GPU computing.
                  Unfortunately, these alternatives are incompatible with
                  most CPU-centric programs and require dynamic conversion
                  from CSR at runtime, thus incurring significant
                  computational and storage overheads. We present LightSpMV,
                  a novel CUDA-compatible SpMV algorithm using the standard
                  CSR format, which achieves high speed by benefiting from
                  the fine-grained dynamic distribution of matrix rows over
                  warps/vectors. In LightSpMV, two dynamic row distribution
                  approaches have been investigated at the vector and warp
                  levels with atomic operations and warp shuffle functions as
                  the fundamental building blocks. We have evaluated
                  LightSpMV using various sparse matrices and further
                  compared it to the CSR-based SpMV subprograms in the
                  state-of-the-art CUSP and cuSPARSE libraries. Performance
                  evaluation reveals that on the same Tesla K40c GPU,
                  LightSpMV is superior to both CUSP and cuSPARSE, with a
                  speedup of up to 2.60 and 2.63 over CUSP, and up to 1.93
                  and 1.79 over cuSPARSE for single and double precision,
                  respectively. LightSpMV is available at
                  http://lightspmv.sourceforge.net.}

  abstract      = {Due to massive thread-level parallelism, GPUs have become
                  an attractive platform for accelerating large-scale data
                  parallel computations, such as graph processing. However,
                  achieving high performance for graph processing with GPUs
                  is non-trivial. Processing graphs on GPUs introduces
                  several problems, such as load imbalance, low utilization
                  of hardware unit, and memory divergence. Although previous
                  work has proposed several software strategies to optimize
                  graph processing on GPUs, there are several issues beyond
                  the capability of software techniques to address.In this
                  article, we present GraphPEG, a graph processing engine for
                  efficient graph processing on GPUs. Inspired by the
                  observation that many graph algorithms have a common
                  pattern on graph traversal, GraphPEG improves the
                  performance of graph processing by coupling automatic edge
                  gathering with fine-grain work distribution. GraphPEG can
                  also adapt to various input graph datasets and simplify the
                  software design of graph processing with hardware-assisted
                  graph traversal. Simulation results show that, in
                  comparison with two representative highly efficient GPU
                  graph processing software framework Gunrock and SEP-Graph,
                  GraphPEG improves graph processing throughput by
                  2.8\texttimes{} and 2.5\texttimes{} on average, and up to
                  7.3\texttimes{} and 7.0\texttimes{} for six graph algorithm
                  benchmarks on six graph datasets, with marginal hardware
                  cost.},

                  uniprocessors, vector processors, shared-memory systems,

                  unit-stride vector operation for each machine, and for each

  abstract      = {The vertex-centric programming model is an established
                  computational paradigm recently incorporated into
                  distributed processing frameworks to address challenges in
                  large-scale graph processing. Billion-node graphs that
                  exceed the memory capacity of commodity machines are not
                  well supported by popular Big Data tools like MapReduce,
                  which are notoriously poor performing for iterative graph
                  algorithms such as PageRank. In response, a new type of
                  framework challenges one to “think like a vertex”
                  (TLAV) and implements user-defined programs from the
                  perspective of a vertex rather than a graph. Such an
                  approach improves locality, demonstrates linear
                  scalability, and provides a natural way to express and
                  compute many iterative graph algorithms. These frameworks
                  are simple to program and widely applicable but, like an
                  operating system, are composed of several intricate,
                  interdependent components, of which a thorough
                  understanding is necessary in order to elicit top
                  performance at scale. To this end, the first comprehensive
                  survey of TLAV frameworks is presented. In this survey, the
                  vertex-centric approach to graph processing is overviewed,
                  TLAV frameworks are deconstructed into four main components
                  and respectively analyzed, and TLAV implementations are
                  reviewed and categorized.},

                  matter, which depends on the readers interests, knowledge
                  and attitudes. But there is still much that can be said
                  objectively about the relative importance of Web pages.
                  This paper describes PageRank, a mathod for rating Web
                  pages objectively and mechanically, effectively measuring
                  the human interest and attention devoted to them. We
                  compare PageRank to an idealized random Web surfer. We show
                  how to efficiently compute PageRank for large numbers of
                  pages. And, we show how to apply PageRank to search and to
                  user navigation.}

                  algorithm for computing vertex betweenness centrality for
                  small world networks on 2 NVIDIA Tesla and Fermi GPUs and
                  compare it to a parallel open source implementation on an
                  Intel multicore CPU. For the test instances considered the
                  betweenness computation on GPU was accelerated by as much
                  as 19.68× compared to single thread CPU performance and
                  more than 2× compared to multithread CPU performance using

  abstract      = {For more than thirty years, the parallel programming
                  community has used the dependence graph as the main
                  abstraction for reasoning about and exploiting parallelism
                  in "regular" algorithms that use dense arrays, such as
                  finite-differences and FFTs. In this paper, we argue that
                  the dependence graph is not a suitable abstraction for
                  algorithms in new application areas like machine learning
                  and network analysis in which the key data structures are
                  "irregular" data structures like graphs, trees, and sets.
                  To address the need for better abstractions, we introduce a
                  data-centric formulation of algorithms called the operator
                  formulation in which an algorithm is expressed in terms of
                  its action on data structures. This formulation is the
                  basis for a structural analysis of algorithms that we call
                  tao-analysis. Tao-analysis can be viewed as an abstraction
                  of algorithms that distills out algorithmic properties
                  important for parallelization. It reveals that a
                  generalized form of data-parallelism called amorphous
                  data-parallelism is ubiquitous in algorithms, and that,
                  depending on the tao-structure of the algorithm, this
                  parallelism may be exploited by compile-time,
                  inspector-executor or optimistic parallelization, thereby
                  unifying these seemingly unrelated parallelization
                  techniques. Regular algorithms emerge as a special case of
                  irregular algorithms, and many application-specific
                  optimization techniques can be generalized to a broader
                  context. These results suggest that the operator
                  formulation and tao-analysis of algorithms can be the
                  foundation of a systematic approach to parallel
                  programming.}

  abstract      = {Motivation: Molecular simulation has historically been a
                  low-throughput technique, but faster computers and
                  increasing amounts of genomic and structural data are
                  changing this by enabling large-scale automated simulation
                  of, for instance, many conformers or mutants of
                  biomolecules with or without a range of ligands. At the
                  same time, advances in performance and scaling now make it
                  possible to model complex biomolecular interaction and
                  function in a manner directly testable by experiment. These
                  applications share a need for fast and efficient software
                  that can be deployed on massive scale in clusters, web
                  servers, distributed computing or cloud resources.Results:
                  Here, we present a range of new simulation algorithms and
                  features developed during the past 4 years, leading up to
                  the GROMACS 4.5 software package. The software now
                  automatically handles wide classes of biomolecules, such as
                  proteins, nucleic acids and lipids, and comes with all
                  commonly used force fields for these molecules built-in.
                  GROMACS supports several implicit solvent models, as well
                  as new free-energy algorithms, and the software now uses
                  multithreading for efficient parallelization even on
                  low-end systems, including windows-based workstations.
                  Together with hand-tuned assembly kernels and
                  state-of-the-art parallelization, this provides extremely
                  high performance and cost efficiency for high-throughput as
                  well as massively parallel simulations.Availability:

                  of social networks, and several algorithms for computing
                  this metric exist in the literature. This paper makes three
                  contributions. First, we show that the problem of computing
                  betweenness centrality can be formulated abstractly in
                  terms of a small set of operators that update the graph.
                  Second, we show that existing parallel algorithms for
                  computing betweenness centrality can be viewed as
                  implementations of different schedules for these operators,
                  permitting all these algorithms to be formulated in a
                  single framework. Third, we derive a new asynchronous
                  parallel algorithm for betweenness centrality that (i)
                  works seamlessly for both weighted and unweighted graphs,
                  (ii) can be applied to large graphs, and (iii) is able to
                  extract large amounts of parallelism. We implemented this
                  algorithm and compared it against a number of publicly
                  available implementations of previous algorithms on two
                  different multicore architectures. Our results show that
                  the new algorithm is the best performing one in most cases,
                  particularly for large graphs and large thread counts, and
                  is always competitive against other algorithms.}

                  considers data clustering, mixture models and dimensional
                  reduction presenting a unified framework applicable to
                  bioinformatics, cheminformatics and demographics.
                  Deterministic annealing is used to lessen effect of local
                  minima. We present performance results on clusters of 2-8
                  core systems identifying effects from cache, runtime
                  fluctuations, synchronization and memory bandwidth. We
                  discuss needed programming model and compare with MPI and
                  other approaches.}

  abstract      = {Image processing pipelines combine the challenges of
                  stencil computations and stream programs. They are composed
                  of large graphs of different stencil stages, as well as
                  complex reductions, and stages with global or
                  data-dependent access patterns. Because of their complex
                  structure, the performance difference between a naive
                  implementation of a pipeline and an optimized one is often
                  an order of magnitude. Efficient implementations require
                  optimization of both parallelism and locality, but due to
                  the nature of stencils, there is a fundamental tension
                  between parallelism, locality, and introducing redundant
                  recomputation of shared values.We present a systematic
                  model of the tradeoff space fundamental to stencil
                  pipelines, a schedule representation which describes
                  concrete points in this space for each stage in an image
                  processing pipeline, and an optimizing compiler for the
                  Halide image processing language that synthesizes high
                  performance implementations from a Halide algorithm and a
                  schedule. Combining this compiler with stochastic search
                  over the space of schedules enables terse, composable
                  programs to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide
                  range of real image processing pipelines, and across
                  different hardware architectures, including multicores with
                  SIMD, and heterogeneous CPU+GPU execution. From simple
                  Halide programs written in a few hours, we demonstrate
                  performance up to 5x faster than hand-tuned C, intrinsics,
                  and CUDA implementations optimized by experts over weeks or
                  months, for image processing applications beyond the reach
                  of past automatic compilers.},

  abstract      = {Motivation: Next-generation DNA sequencing machines are
                  generating an enormous amount of sequence data, placing
                  unprecedented demands on traditional single-processor
                  read-mapping algorithms. CloudBurst is a new parallel
                  read-mapping algorithm optimized for mapping next-
                  generation sequence data to the human genome and other
                  reference genomes, for use in a variety of biological
                  analyses including SNP discovery, genotyping and personal
                  genomics. It is modeled after the short read-mapping
                  program RMAP, and reports either all alignments or the
                  unambiguous best alignment for each read with any number of
                  mismatches or differences. This level of sensitivity could
                  be prohibitively time consuming, but CloudBurst uses the
                  open-source Hadoop implementation of MapReduce to
                  parallelize execution using multiple compute nodes.
                  Results: CloudBurst's running time scales linearly with the
                  number of reads mapped, and with near linear speedup as the
                  number of processors increases. In a 24-processor core
                  configuration, CloudBurst is up to 30 times faster than
                  RMAP executing on a single core, while computing an
                  identical set of alignments. Using a larger remote compute
                  cloud with 96 cores, CloudBurst improved performance by
                  >100- fold, reducing the running time from hours to mere
                  minutes for typical jobs involving mapping of millions of
                  short reads to the human genome. Availability: CloudBurst
                  is available open-source as a model for parallelizing
                  algorithms with MapReduce at http://cloudburst-

                  in high-performance and scientific computing, and despite
                  increasingly general-purpose hardware capabilities, the use
                  of GPUs in network servers or distributed systems poses
                  significant challenges. GPUnet is a native GPU networking
                  layer that provides a socket abstraction and high-level
                  networking APIs for GPU programs. We use GPUnet to
                  streamline the development of high-performance, distributed
                  applications like in-GPU-memory MapReduce and a new class
                  of low-latency, high-throughput GPU-native network services
                  such as a face verification server.}

  abstract      = {GPGPU has received a lot of attention recently as a cost
                  effective solution for high performance computing. In this
                  paper we present a parallel algorithm for computing
                  Betweenness centrality (BC) using CUDA. BC is an important
                  metric in small world network analysis which is expensive
                  to compute. While there are existing parallel
                  implementations, ours is the first implementation on
                  commodity hardware. Our algorithm exploits parallelism at
                  multiple levels of granularity to achieve good performance.
                  We conduct several experiments to show that the algorithm
                  gives considerable speedup over sequential algorithms. We
                  also provide a detailed analysis of the performance of the
                  algorithm.}

                  approaches targeted for massively parallel architectures,
                  which in combination allow a wider range of algorithms to
                  be executed on modern graphics processors. At first, we
                  describe a new processing model which enables the efficient
                  execution of dynamic, irregular workloads. Then, we present
                  the currently fastest queuing algorithm for graphics
                  processors, the most efficient dynamic memory allocator for
                  massively parallel architectures, and the only autonomous
                  scheduler for graphics processing units that can
                  dynamically support different granularities of parallelism.
                  Finally, we show how these scheduling approaches help to
                  advance the state-of-the-art in the rendering,
                  visualization and procedural modeling.}},

  abstract      = {Efficient implementations of HPC applications for parallel
                  architectures generally rely on external software packages
                  (e.g., BLAS, LAPACK, CUDNN). While these libraries provide
                  highly optimized routines for certain characteristics of
                  inputs (e.g., square matrices), they generally do not
                  retain optimal performance across the wide range of
                  problems encountered in practice. In this paper, we present
                  an input-aware auto-tuning framework for matrix
                  multiplications and convolutions, ISAAC, which uses
                  predictive modeling techniques to drive highly
                  parameterized PTX code templates towards not only
                  hardware-, but also application-specific kernels. Numerical
                  experiments on the NVIDIA Maxwell and Pascal architectures
                  show up to 3x performance gains over both cuBLAS and cuDNN
                  after only a few hours of auto-tuning.},

                  syntax tree describing the problem. This concise
                  representation of the global structure of the problem
                  allows Convex to infer whether the problem complies with
                  the rules of disciplined convex programming (DCP), and to
                  pass the problem to a suitable solver. These operations are
                  carried out in Julia using multiple dispatch, which
                  dramatically reduces the time required to verify DCP
                  compliance and to parse a problem into conic form. Convex
                  then automatically chooses an appropriate backend solver to
                  solve the conic form problem.},

                  tool for energies defined over an MRF and have found
                  applications in image segmentation, stereo vision, image
                  restoration, etc. The maxflow/mincut algorithm to compute
                  graph-cuts is computationally heavy. The best-reported
                  implementation of graph cuts takes over 100 milliseconds
                  even on images of size 640times480 and cannot be used for
                  real-time applications or when iterated applications are
                  needed. The commodity Graphics Processor Unit (GPU) has
                  emerged as an economical and fast computation co-processor
                  recently. In this paper, we present an implementation of
                  the push-relabel algorithm for graph cuts on the GPU. We
                  can perform over 60 graph cuts per second on 1024times1024
                  images and over 150 graph cuts per second on 640times480
                  images on an Nvidia 8800 GTX. The time for each complete
                  graph-cut is about 1 millisecond when only a few weights
                  change from the previous graph, as on dynamic graphs
                  resulting from videos. The CUDA code with a well-defined
                  interface can be downloaded for anyonepsilas use.},

                  where dynamic memory allocation is used for building the
                  kd-tree data structure. Following the performance analysis

                  that address the limitations of the existing dynamic memory
                  allocators. The new dynamic memory allocator uses few

                  memory allocations on massively parallel hardware

  abstract      = {In general, the performance of parallel graph processing
                  is determined by three pairs of critical parameters, namely
                  synchronous or asynchronous execution mode (Sync or Async),
                  Push or Pull communication mechanism (Push or Pull), and
                  Data-driven or Topology-driven traversing scheme (DD or
                  TD), which increases the complexity and sophistication of
                  programming and system implementation of GPU. Existing
                  graph-processing frameworks mainly use a single combination
                  in the entire execution for a given application, but we
                  have observed their variable and suboptimal performance. In
                  this paper, we present SEP-Graph, a highly efficient
                  software framework for graph-processing on GPU. The hybrid
                  execution mode is automatically switched among three pairs
                  of parameters, with an objective to achieve the shortest
                  execution time in each iteration. We also apply a set of
                  optimizations to SEP-Graph, considering the characteristics
                  of graph algorithms and underlying GPU architectures. We
                  show the effectiveness of SEP-Graph based on our intensive
                  and comparative performance evaluation on NVIDIA 1080,
                  P100, and V100 GPUs. Compared with existing and
                  representative GPU graph-processing framework Groute and
                  Gunrock, SEP-Graph can reduce execution time up to 45.8
                  times and 39.4 times.},

                  necessary to design algorithms to manage data, access
                  memory under \{GPU\} memory hierarchy, and schedule more
                  efficient threads. In this paper, we propose an efficient
                  data management and task management designed for \{GPU\}
                  based ray tracing. Due to the dynamic and uncertainty in
                  ray tracing, we design data-management layer and
                  task-management layer combined with fuzzy spatial analysis,
                  use the two-level ray sorting and a ray bucket structure to
                  reorganize ray data, then a warp's threads can be scheduled
                  to access coherent geometry and nodes data, reduce memory
                  bandwidth, and dispatch the data locally. We schedule tasks
                  in data-driven execution according to coherent data,
                  propose an adaptive ray compaction to eliminate inactive
                  threads, maintain task efficiency of threads in a warp, and
                  design two heuristics to decrease the compaction cost. On
                  the basis of it, we also introduce a memory-optimized
                  dynamic traversal management to reduce incoherent memory
                  access, and avoid frequent sorting computation and
                  compaction operations. Our experiments demonstrate all of
                  these work combined can achieve good performance. "

                  for large-scale data-parallel applications such as web
                  indexing, data mining, and scientific simulation. Hadoop is
                  an open-source implementation of MapReduce enjoying wide
                  adoption and is often used for short jobs where low
                  response time is critical. Hadoop's performance is closely
                  tied to its task scheduler, which implicitly assumes that
                  cluster nodes are homogeneous and tasks make progress
                  linearly, and uses these assumptions to decide when to
                  speculatively re-execute tasks that appear to be
                  stragglers. In practice, the homogeneity assumptions do not
                  always hold. An especially compelling setting where this
                  occurs is a virtualized data center, such as Amazon's
                  Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). We show that Hadoop's
                  scheduler can cause severe performance degradation in
                  heterogeneous environments. We design a new scheduling
                  algorithm, Longest Approximate Time to End (LATE), that is
                  both simple and highly robust to heterogeneity. LATE can
                  improve Hadoop response times by a factor of 2 in 200-node
                  clusters on EC2.}

                  there exists a copy of a pattern graph in a target graph.
                  We introduce in this paper a global constraint and an
                  associated filtering algorithm to solve this problem within
                  the context of constraint programming. The main idea of the
                  filtering algorithm is to label every node with respect to
                  its relationships with other nodes of the graph, and to
                  define a partial order on these labels in order to express
                  compatibility of labels for subgraph isomorphism. This
                  partial order over labels is used to filter domains.
                  Labelings can also be strengthened by adding information
                  from the labels of neighbors. Such a strengthening can be
                  applied iteratively until a fixpoint is reached. Practical
                  experiments illustrate that our new filtering approach is
                  more effective on difficult instances of scale free graphs
                  than state-of-the-art algorithms and other constraint
                  programming approaches.",

  abstract      = {Dynamic parallelism allows GPU kernels to launch
                  additional kernels at runtime directly from the GPU. In
                  this paper we show that dynamic parallelism enables
                  relatively simple high-performance graph algorithms for
                  GPUs. We present breadth-first search (BFS) and
                  single-source shortest paths (SSSP) algorithms that use
                  dynamic parallelism to adapt to the irregular and
                  data-driven nature of these problems. Our approach results
                  in simple code that closely follows the high-level
                  description of the algorithms but yields performance
                  competitive with the current state of the art.},

                  recommendation systems. Recently, researchers extend the
                  classical matrix factorization and allows for a generic
                  integration of contextual information by modeling the data
                  as a tensor. However, current tensor factorization methods
                  suffer from the limitation that the computing cost can be
                  very high in practice. In this paper, we propose GALS, a
                  GPU based parallel tensor factorization algorithm, to
                  accelerate the tensor factorization on large data sets to
                  support the efficient context-aware recommendation.
                  Experiments show that the proposed method can achieve 10
                  times faster than the current tensor factorization
                  methods.}

                  play an important role in many practical applications that
                  help users manage information and provide personalized
                  recommendations. The context in which a choice is made is
                  an important factor for recommendation systems. Recently,
                  researchers extended the classical matrix factorization to
                  enable generic integration of contextual information by
                  modeling the relevant data as a tensor. However, current
                  tensor factorization methods have two important
                  limitations: (1) computing costs can be very high in
                  practice and (2) they can only be applied to static
                  conditions. In this paper, we propose the GPUTENSOR, a
                  parallel tensor factorization algorithm, to accelerate the
                  tensor factorization of large datasets to support efficient
                  context-aware recommendations. The basic idea of this
                  algorithm is to partition a tensor into smaller blocks and
                  then exploit the inherent parallelism and high memory
                  bandwidth of Graphics Processing Units (GPU) to perform
                  tensor related operations in parallel. Furthermore, based
                  on the observation that contextual information changes
                  dynamically and frequently, we present GPUTENSOR+, an
                  effective incremental method that models the apparent
                  changes of a tensor by adaptively updating its previously
                  factorized components instead of recomputing them on the
                  whole dataset every time data are changed. Experiments
                  indicate that the proposed methods can achieve significant
                  timesavings without a significant loss in accuracy. As an
                  important data mining tool, these methods can be used a
                  potential basis for many other interesting tensor
                  applications, such as clustering, trend detection, social
                  network analysis, and latent concept discovery.}
