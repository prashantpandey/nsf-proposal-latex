    abstract = "{Substrings of length k, commonly referred to as k-mers, play a vital role in sequence analysis. However, k-mers are limited to exact matches between sequences leading to alternative constructs. We recently introduced a class of new constructs, strobemers, that can match across substitutions and smaller insertions and deletions. Randstrobes, the most sensitive strobemer proposed in Sahlin (Effective sequence similarity detection with strobemers. Genome Res 2021a;31:2080–94. https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.275648.121), has been used in several bioinformatics applications such as read classification, short-read mapping, and read overlap detection. Recently, we showed that the more pseudo-random the behavior of the construction (measured in entropy), the more efficient the seeds for sequence similarity analysis. The level of pseudo-randomness depends on the construction operators, but no study has investigated the efficacy.In this study, we introduce novel construction methods, including a Binary Search Tree-based approach that improves time complexity over previous methods. To our knowledge, we are also the first to address biases in construction and design three metrics for measuring bias. Our evaluation shows that our methods have favorable speed and sampling uniformity compared to existing approaches. Lastly, guided by our results, we change the seed construction in strobealign, a short-read mapper, and find that the results change substantially. We suggest combining the two results to improve strobealign’s accuracy for the shortest reads in our evaluated datasets. Our evaluation highlights sampling biases that can occur and provides guidance on which operators to use when implementing randstrobes.All methods and evaluation benchmarks are available in a public Github repository at https://github.com/Moein-Karami/RandStrobes. The scripts for running the strobealign analysis are found at https://github.com/NBISweden/strobealign-evaluation.}",

In case of Homo sapiens, the number of sequenced genomes will approach hundreds of thousands in the next few years. Simply scaling up established bioinformatics pipelines will not be sufficient for leveraging the full potential of such rich genomic data sets. Instead, novel, qualitatively different computational methods and paradigms are needed. We will witness the rapid extension of computational pan-genomics, a new sub-area of research in computational biology. In this article, we generalize existing definitions and understand a pan-genome as any collection of genomic sequences to be analyzed jointly or to be used as a reference. We examine already available approaches to construct and use pan-genomes, discuss the potential benefits of future technologies and methodologies and review open challenges from the vantage point of the above-mentioned biological disciplines. As a prominent example for a computational paradigm shift, we particularly highlight the transition from the representation of reference genomes as strings to representations as graphs. We outline how this and other challenges from different application domains translate into common computational problems, point out relevant bioinformatics techniques and identify open problems in computer science. With this review, we aim to increase awareness that a joint approach to computational pan-genomics can help address many of the problems currently faced in various domains.}",
