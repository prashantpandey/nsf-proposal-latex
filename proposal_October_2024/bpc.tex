\section*{Broadening Participation in Computing (BPC) Plan – Connected}

Our BPC Plans are connected to the departmental plans. Therefore, (1) goal and
context, (2) intended population, (3) strategy, and (4) measurement are already
addressed in Verified Departmental BPC Plans, which are attached. The PI and
Co-PIs, will focus on multiple aspects of the departmental BPC Plans. This
includes undergraduate recruiting and marketing to prospective undergraduate
students (A6 Northeastern Plan), collaborations with MS students (A7 –
Northeastern plan), and PhD research (A8 – Northeastern plan). Undergraduate
marketing and recruiting (including research) will be done through our
engineering expos and welcome weeks. We will build a demo of the proposed
research and present it to the students at these events. During these events,
we will also engage with students to discuss the interdisciplinary nature of
our research and how engineering can be used to solve real-world problems.  All
PIs will also collaborate with student organizations such as women in
technology (WIT) at the Northeastern University. This will include helping to
organize and speak at events. Along with this, we will also aim to recruit
minority and women graduate students to participate in the proposed research.
