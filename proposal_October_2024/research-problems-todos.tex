\section*{Research Problems Todos}

My assignment was to look at the research problems and assign ``validation'' or, more broadly, some means for evaluation for each of these research problems.

If you are the last person to finish your assignment, do the above and go into proposal.tex and remove the line that inputs this file (research-problems-todos.tex).
