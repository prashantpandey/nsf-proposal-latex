@inproceedings{AhnGM13,
	abstract = {We present a new bound relating edge connectivity in
                  a simple, unweighted graph with effective resistance
                  in the corresponding electrical network. The bound
                  is tight. While we believe the bound is of
                  independent interest, our work is motivated by the
                  problem of constructing combinatorial and spectral
                  sparsifiers of a graph, i.e., sparse, weighted
                  sub-graphs that preserve cut information (in the
                  case of combinatorial sparsifiers) and additional
                  spectral information (in the case of spectral
                  sparsifiers). Recent results by Fung et al. (STOC
                  2011) and Spielman and Srivastava (SICOMP 2011) show
                  that sampling edges with probability based on
                  edge-connectivity gives rise to a combinatorial
                  sparsifier whereas sampling edges with probability
                  based on effective resistance gives rise to a
                  spectral sparsifier. Our result implies that by
                  simply increasing the sampling probability by a
                  O(n2/3) factor in the combinatorial sparsifier
                  construction, we also preserve the spectral
                  properties of the graph. Combining this with the
                  algorithms of Ahn et al. (SODA 2012, PODS 2012)
                  gives rise to the first data stream algorithm for
                  the construction of spectral sparsifiers in the
                  dynamic setting where edges can be added or removed
                  from the stream. This was posed as an open question
                  by Kelner and Levin (STACS 2011).},

	abstract = {A temporal graph is, informally speaking, a graph
                  that changes with time. When time is discrete and
                  only the relationships between the participating
                  entities may change and not the entities themselves,
                  a temporal graph may be viewed as a sequence
                  {\$}{\$}G{\_}1,G{\_}2{\backslash}ldots
                  ,G{\_}l{\$}{\$}of static graphs over the same
                  (static) set of nodes V. Though static graphs have
                  been extensively studied, for their temporal
                  generalization we are still far from having a
                  concrete set of structural and algorithmic
                  principles. Recent research shows that many graph
                  properties and problems become radically different
                  and usually substantially more difficult when an
                  extra time dimension in added to them. Moreover,
                  there is already a rich and rapidly growing set of
                  modern systems and applications that can be
                  naturally modeled and studied via temporal graphs.
                  This, further motivates the need for the development
                  of a temporal extension of graph theory. We survey
                  here recent results on temporal graphs and temporal
                  graph problems that have appeared in the Computer
                  Science community.},

	abstractnote = {There has been a growing interest in the graph-streaming setting where a continuous stream of graph updates is mixed with graph queries. In principle, purely-functional trees are an ideal fit for this setting as they enable safe parallelism, lightweight snapshots, and strict serializability for queries. However, directly using them for graph processing leads to significant space overhead and poor cache locality. This paper presents C-trees, a compressed purely-functional search tree data structure that significantly improves on the space usage and locality of purely-functional trees. We design theoretically-efficient and practical algorithms for performing batch updates to C-trees, and also show that we can store massive dynamic real-world graphs using only a few bytes per edge, thereby achieving space usage close to that of the best static graph processing frameworks. To study the applicability of our data structure, we designed Aspen, a graph-streaming framework that extends the interface of Ligra with operations for updating graphs. We show that Aspen is faster than two state-of-the-art graph-streaming systems, Stinger and LLAMA, while requiring less memory, and is competitive in performance with the state-of-the-art static graph frameworks, Galois, GAP, and Ligra+. With Aspen, we are able to efficiently process the largest publicly-available graph with over two hundred billion edges in the graph-streaming setting using a single commodity multicore server with 1TB of memory.},

                  analysis of the outcome of what may be the most
                  extensive effort to selectively censor human
                  expression ever implemented. To do this, we have
                  devised a system to locate, download, and analyze
                  the content of millions of social media posts
                  originating from nearly 1,400 different social media
                  services all over China before the Chinese
                  government is able to find, evaluate, and censor
                  (i.e., remove from the Internet) the large subset
                  they deem objectionable. Using modern
                  computer-assisted text analytic methods that we
                  adapt to and validate in the Chinese language, we
                  compare the substantive content of posts censored to
                  those not censored over time in each of 85 topic
                  areas. Contrary to previous understandings, posts
                  with negative, even vitriolic, criticism of the
                  state, its leaders, and its policies are not more
                  likely to be censored. Instead, we show that the
                  censorship program is aimed at curtailing collective
                  action by silencing comments that represent,
                  reinforce, or spur social mobilization, regardless
                  of content. Censorship is oriented toward attempting
                  to forestall collective activities that are
                  occurring now or may occur in the future --- and, as
                  such, seem to clearly expose government intent.},

@inproceedings{clustering,
	abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of \emphcorrelation clustering in the dynamic data stream model. The stream consists of updates to the edge weights of a graph on&nbsp;n nodes and the goal is to find a node-partition such that the end-points of negative-weight edges are typically in different clusters whereas the end-points of positive-weight edges are typically in the same cluster. We present polynomial-time, O(n⋅\textpolylog n)-space approximation algorithms for natural problems that arise. We first develop data structures based on linear sketches that allow the ``quality'' of a given node-partition to be measured. We then combine these data structures with convex programming and sampling techniques to solve the relevant approximation problem. However the standard LP and SDP formulations are not obviously solvable in O(n⋅\textpolylog n)-space. Our work presents space-efficient algorithms for the convex programming required, as well as approaches to reduce the adaptivity of the sampling. Note that the improved space and running-time bounds achieved from streaming algorithms are also useful for offline settings such as MapReduce models.},

@article{ubiquitous,
	abstract = {Graph processing is becoming increasingly prevalent
                  across many application domains. In spite of this
                  prevalence, there is little research about how
                  graphs are actually used in practice. We conducted
                  an online survey aimed at understanding: (i) the
                  types of graphs users have; (ii) the graph
                  computations users run; (iii) the types of graph
                  software users use; and (iv) the major challenges
                  users face when processing their graphs. We describe
                  the participants' responses to our questions
                  highlighting common patterns and challenges. We
                  further reviewed user feedback in the mailing lists,
                  bug reports, and feature requests in the source
                  repositories of a large suite of software products
                  for processing graphs. Through our review, we were
                  able to answer some new questions that were raised
                  by participants' responses and identify specific
                  challenges that users face when using different
                  classes of graph software. The participants'
                  responses and data we obtained revealed surprising
                  facts about graph processing in practice. In
                  particular, real-world graphs represent a very
                  diverse range of entities and are often very large,
                  and scalability and visualization are undeniably the
                  most pressing challenges faced by participants. We
                  hope these findings can guide future research.},
