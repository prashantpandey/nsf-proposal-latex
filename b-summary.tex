\noindent {\bf \large Overview:}\\

\noindent This project will develop theoretically well-founded data structures for modern accelarators hardare, such as GPUs. Specifically, we will develop a compact, dynamic, and distributed data structure library for GPUs.


\noindent {\bf \large Intellectual Merit:}\\

\noindent Tell reviewers why your project is scientifically interesting.\\

\noindent {\bf \large Broader Impacts: }\\

\noindent Tell reviewers about other outcomes of your project beyond the science. Ideas include ancillary products, outreach, and more.
